Blitz Full Screen URL Launcher
==================================

This is a very simple, clean extension which places a button in the top right hand corner and allows you to navigate to easily navigate to URLs when Chrome is in full-screen mode. 

You can bind the extension to a key once installed by navigating to chrome://extensions, scrolling down the bottom and looking for the link "Configure Commands".  When in full screen mode you can then hit "CTRL-Shift-L", type your URL and hit enter.

This plugin works by simply using javascript to redirect the current window to the URL you type.  It doesn't view track your history or your links and there are no analytics trackers attached either.
